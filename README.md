Wilson is a lightweight JavaScript library for creating math applets. It handles common boilerplate tasks like capturing mouse and touch input, makes parallelized gpu-based applets as easy as writing a shader, and even provides a robust and customizable fullscreen alternative. All of this streamlines your work and simplifies your applets, letting you focus on the code that matters.
